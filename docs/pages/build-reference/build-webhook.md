title: Build webhooks
---

EAS can alert you as soon as your build has completed via a webhook. Webhooks need to be configured per-project, so if you want to be alerted about builds for both `@johndoe/awesomeApp` and `@johndoe/coolApp`, you need to run `eas webhook:create` in each directory.

After running the command, you'll have to provide the webhook URL (or specify it with the `--url` flag) that handles HTTP POST requests. Additionally, you'll have to input a webhook signing secret, if you have not already provided it with the `--secret` flag. It must be at least 16 characters long, and it will be used to calculate the signature of the request body which we send as the value of the `expo-signature` HTTP header. You can use the signature to verify a webhook request is genuine (example code below).

We call your webhook using an HTTP POST request and we pass data in the request body. EAS sends the build data as a JSON object. The most notable fields are:

- `id` - the unique ID of your build
- `status` - a string specifying whether your build has finished successfully (can be either `finished` or `errored`)
- `artifacts.buildUrl` - the URL to the build artifact (only included if `status === 'finished'`)

Additionally, we send an `expo-signature` HTTP header with the hash signature of the payload. You can use this signature to verify the authenticity of the request. The signature is a hex-encoded HMAC-SHA1 digest of the request body, using your webhook secret as the HMAC key.

Here's an example of how you can implement your server:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const safeCompare = require('safe-compare');

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.text({ type: '*/*' }));
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const expoSignature = req.headers['expo-signature'];
  // process.env.SECRET_WEBHOOK_KEY has to match SECRET value set with `eas webhook:create` command
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha1', process.env.SECRET_WEBHOOK_KEY);
  hmac.update(req.body);
  const hash = `sha1=${hmac.digest('hex')}`;
  if (!safeCompare(expoSignature, hash)) {
    res.status(500).send("Signatures didn't match!");
  } else {
    // do something here, like send a notification to Slack!
    // console.log(req.body);
    res.send('OK!');
  }
});
app.listen(8080, () => console.log('Listening on port 8080'));
```

> If you want to test the above webhook locally, you have to use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs) to forward `localhost:8080` via a tunnel and make it publicly accessible to anyone with the URL `ngrok` gives you.

You can always change your webhook URL and/or webhook secret using `eas webhook:update --id WEBHOOK_ID`. You can find the webhook ID by running `eas webhook:list`. If you would like us to stop sending requests to your webhook, run `expo webhook:delete` and choose the webhook from the list.
