**`expo-linear-gradient`** provides a native React view that transitions between multiple colors in a linear direction.

## Installation

<InstallSection packageName="expo-linear-gradient" />

## Usage

<SnackInline label='Linear Gradient' dependencies={['expo-linear-gradient']}>

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { LinearGradient } from 'expo-linear-gradient';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <LinearGradient
        // Background Linear Gradient
        colors={['rgba(0,0,0,0.8)', 'transparent']}
        style={styles.background}
      />
      <LinearGradient
        // Button Linear Gradient
        colors={['#4c669f', '#3b5998', '#192f6a']}
        style={styles.button}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Sign in with Facebook</Text>
      </LinearGradient>
    </View>
  );
}

/* @hide const styles = StyleSheet.create({ ... }); */
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: 'orange',
  },
  background: {
    position: 'absolute',
    left: 0,
    right: 0,
    top: 0,
    height: 300,
  },
  button: {
    padding: 15,
    alignItems: 'center',
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
  text: {
    backgroundColor: 'transparent',
    fontSize: 15,
    color: '#fff',
  },
});
/* @end */
```

</SnackInline>

## API

```js
import { LinearGradient } from 'expo-linear-gradient';
```

### props

`colors`  
An array of colors that represent stops in the gradient. At least two colors are required (for a single-color background, use the `style.backgroundColor` prop on a `View` component).

`start`  
An object `{ x: number; y: number }` or array `[x, y]` that represents the point at which the gradient starts, as a fraction of the overall size of the gradient ranging from 0 to 1, inclusive.
For example, `{ x: 0.1, y: 0.2 }` means that the gradient will start `10%` from the left and `20%` from the top.
**On web**, this only changes the angle of the gradient because CSS gradients don't support changing the starting position.

`end`  
An object `{ x: number; y: number }` or array `[x, y]` that represents the position at which the gradient ends, as a fraction of the overall size of the gradient ranging from 0 to 1, inclusive.
For example, `{ x: 0.1, y: 0.2 }` means that the gradient will end `10%` from the left and `20%` from the bottom.
**On web**, this only changes the angle of the gradient because CSS gradients don't support changing the end position.

`locations`  
An array that contains `number`s ranging from 0 to 1, inclusive, and is the same length as the `colors` property. Each number indicates a color-stop location where each respective color should be located.
For example, `[0.5, 0.8]` would render:

- the first color, solid, from the beginning of the gradient view to 50% through (the middle);
- a gradient from the first color to the second from the 50% point to the 80% point; and
- the second color, solid, from the 80% point to the end of the gradient view.

The color-stop locations must be ascending from least to greatest.
